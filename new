When it come's to run a software company, I personally believe in one thing and that is skill's. No matter if you are college dropped or work in a Garage. You know how to make functional apps or good UI/UX? You are always welcome.

Principle Number One: Recognize That I'm in the Software Business. 
Whether or not I know it, I am almost certainly in the software business. If yours is like most businesses, software plays a pivotal role in most of your operations. For example, software schedule delays affect product delivery dates, and product delivery dates drive cost, revenue, and profit. Unless you can manage revenue and profit, you cannot manage a business. If you do not treat software as a critical part of your future, you cannot manage software, and then you might not even be able to manage your business.

Principal Number Two: Quality Must Be the Top Priority
In software work, quality problems overwhelm everything else. Quality is critical, and when quality is not managed, entire software projects are unmanageable. There are known ways to manage software quality, but they require proper training and disciplined engineering methods. The key need is for you to make a commitment to quality. You must make software quality the top priority.

Principal Number Three: Quality Software Is Developed by Disciplined and Motivated People.
I can not run an effective software operation without disciplined and motivated people. Software development is intellectual work, and undisciplined or unmotivated people cannot do timely or predictable intellectual work. Your people must be personally committed to their work, and they must care about the quality of the products they produce.
